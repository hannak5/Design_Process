# Design Process
Checkpoint #2

## Assignment:
Using the phases that have been explained in this checkpoint, self-assess your strengths and weaknesses in each area of the Design Process. Rank your experience as being low, medium or high in each phase.

Please be detailed in your response. If you feel like you have a lot of experience in a particular phase, share that background in your submission.

## The Design Process

- [x] **Discovery** | Experience level: Medium
 
* In both my architectural and lighting design background, discovery was the first phase of a project. We were required to submit project briefs and timelines as well as clarify the scope of the project during the stakeholder meetings.
* Although, the deliverables will be slightly different for UX/UI Design, the process reads similar in terms of goals.

- [x] **Strategy Phase** | Experience level: Medium
* Strategical planning is integral to the architectural design process, specifically because there are various disciplines working in tandem. Design proposals usually delivered the intended designs for potential discussions with the stakeholders. 
* This phase was also used to introduce possible additions to scope which could possibly improve the overall solution. 
* Similar to competition analysis, precedent projects were studied in-depth to understand and learn the components of the successful designs. 
* User Research is also done at this phase to understand how the space will be used. This data is used as one of the design parameters since it is integral in determining the success of the architecture once it is built. 

- [ ] **Information Architecture** | Experience level: Low
* Since the testing of a space is not possible in a built structure. My experience in this phase is not vast. However, in lighting design sometimes a prototype is tested on site to ensure it meets the requirements, aesthetically and functionally. 
* User flows and storyboarding were regularly used as techniques to visualize how a user could possibly use the space. But it would be considered part of the sketches/diagrams used in the strategical planning phase.


- [x] **Visual Design** | Experience level: Medium
* Visual Design is an integral component of all the architectural documents since the presentation boards in all critiques were standalone documents. They were supposed to explain the project in images and text as and when required. Hence, getting the typography, text hierarchy, image hierarchy and color, to name a few, were integral to the success of your project being understood by the critics. However, this wasn't taught or targeted explicitly as it is done in Graphic/UX/UI design. Hence, I believe I have a lot to learn about the nuances of these decisions in the overall success of the project.

- [ ] **Development** | Experience level: Low
* A similar phase in construction industry is the preliminary construction documentation. It is usually done to ensure all the disciplines are working in tandem, there is no issues of overlap of one system over another, e.g. mechanical air vent where a door needs to be. 
* However, there was no coding involved and no user testing involved.

- [x] **Launch** | Experience level: Medium
* This was the last phase of any architectural or lighting design. It usually involved completed comprehensive construction documentation, detail drawings and everything to get the building built. Although it was not user-tested, it involved _"deploying the solution into a live environment for public use."_
* However, there were no repetition of the discovery phase or a Heuristics checklist. 
* Presentation of the completed work is done afterwards as part of client launch, competition submissions, award receptions and the like.
